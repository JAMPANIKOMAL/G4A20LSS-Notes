# Notes on "The Design of the UNIX Operating System"

These are my notes on the classic operating systems book: **The Design of the UNIX Operating System** by **Maurice J. Bach**.

I am doing a course MSc CS - Sem I.

We have a subject by the topic **CS-501-MJ: Advanced Operating System**, this is our reference book.

I would like to thank our Teacher **Mrs. Shabeena Khan** and the entire department

If you feel that corrections are required, feel free to create a PR! :)
